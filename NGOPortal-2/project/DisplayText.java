            "we launched Learning Institute, its vocational skilling arm. " +
            "The objective was to train youth from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (age 18‐25 years) and provide them with employable skills, " +
            "coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. " +
            "Today the institute programs across the country enable youth to access entry-level positions and placements in 10 major vocations. " +

            "leaving the vast majority of youth without the skills, knowhow or networks to enter the workforce. " +
